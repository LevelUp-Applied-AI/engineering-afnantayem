# AI.SPIRE Pre-Work — Phase 3: Engineering Practices

**GitHub Classroom Phase 3 repo.** Days 6–9.

Phase 3 covers PR hygiene, pytest, SQL, and Docker — the engineering practices that make code reviewable, testable, and deployable.

## Setup

Your venv and all packages from `requirements-prework.txt` should already be installed from Day 3. If you need to reinstall:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux
# or: source .venv/Scripts/activate  (Windows Git Bash)
pip install -r requirements-prework.txt
```
## How to run
1. Set up the environment
From the root project directory, activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:
source .venv/Scripts/activate

On Mac/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate
Then install dependencies (if applicable):
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the code
Make sure you are in the root directory of the project.
Run the main script using:
python main.py
(Replace main.py with the actual entry-point file if different.)

3. Confirm success
The program should run without errors.
You should see the expected output printed in the terminal (e.g., processed results, confirmation message, or generated file).
If no errors appear and the expected behavior occurs, the setup is successful.
